		<content>A minor patch renaming this mod in line with a new series I may or may not expand now that I've released GiTS Cyberbrains! Also, all gun textures in this mod have been upscaled for Camera+ users.

|Patch Notes:
* Mod name changed to 'GiTS Seburo Advanced Weapon Systems' in line with mod series; also updated preview image.
* All guns textures have been upscaled for camera mods that provide zoom, such as Camera+, to be able to catch more details on the textures.
* HugsLib's mod update news feature is now supported; additionally to be 100% clear, HugsLib is NOT a new dependency and is NOT required to run this mod.
* Changes to Manifest.xml and About.xml to update or provide support for some external mod managers.
* Minor folder and file structure changes.</content>
