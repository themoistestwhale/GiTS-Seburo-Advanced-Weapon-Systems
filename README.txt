// DESCRIPTION
Seburo Advanced Weapons Systems is a Japanese megacorporation tasked with creating modern security equipment. Founded in 2024, Seburo provides only the most cutting-edge in small arms weaponry available, found in a multitude of military and police units across the globe. In demanding situations where gear is paramount, Seburo provides an experience unrivalled by any other.

This mod adds 14 new advanced industrial weapons from the world of Ghost in the Shell, with a focus on the Stand Alone Complex series. While all the guns included in this mod are relatively unique to some extent or another, focus is placed on high armor penetration for cyberised or armored opponents. Some weapons are extremely heavy and bulky, relying on hard firepower to accomplish this and its user to be heavily cyberised themselves to manage the weight. Others, meanwhile, are light and compact concealable arms that trade off overall firepower or range for this capability. Nonetheless, all these arms remain effective, and many of them specialise in combat in close quarters. All of these weapons will hopefully make interesting additions to your colony's armory!

Included also are multiple 'iconic weapons' from the series, including; Batou's handgun, Togusa's Revolver and Motoko's SMG from the original movie.

// WHAT'S INSIDE

# SIDEARMS
- Seburo M5: The iconic sidearm is highly concealable and features SA/DA firing as well as an ambidextrous safety. For Combat Extended, this handgun uses 5.45x18mm ammunition and has a 20 round double-stack magazine.
- Seburo M10: This M5 in spirit features a longer barrel but still remains its concealability. For Combat Extended, this handgun uses 5.45x18mm ammunition and has a 20 shot capacity.
- BDA M-7: This fictional variant of the BDA series chambered in .45 ACP. For Combat Extended, this gun uses .45 ACP ammunition and has a 14 round double-stack magazine.
- 2008M: This fictional revolver utilises firing recoil to revolve the cylinder as well as re-engage it. It features a speedloader and is rather compact. For Combat Extended, this revolver uses .357 magnum ammunition and has a 6 shot capacity.

# SMGS
- Seburo C-25A: This slightly janky compact PDW features forward ejection and a top-mounted brass catcher. It has an extremely high fire rate and utilises rounds capable of penetrating cyberised targets and lightly armored foes, but also has somewhat lackluster velocity. For Combat Extended, 5.45x45mm ammunition with a 50 round capacity.
- Seburo C-27A: Described as a close quarters suppression firearm, this submachine gun will dominate in close quarters and features the same armor-piercing rounds of the C-25A. Additionally, this gun has an underbarrel high-velocity direct fire 20mm launcher firing HESH grenades for harder targets. For Combat Extended, 5.45x45mm ammunition with a 50 round capacity for the primary gun, and 20x42mm HESH grenades for the underbarrel launcher.
- CZN M-22: An iconic submachine gun, this bullpup design no longer requires barrel changes after excessive use in combat and has appreciable performance at distance for a SMG. For Combat Extended, 5.7x28mm SS190 ammunition with a 30 round capacity. Additionally, the overpressure rounds featured in the movie have been added for this gun specifically, which it will default to rather than FMJ rounds.

# RIFLES
- Seburo C-26A: This bullpup assault rifle utilises specialised rounds that can penetrate cyberised or lightly-armored targets with a focus towards urban close quarters combat. Comes with a laser sight built into the frame above the muzzle. For Combat Extended, 5.45x45mm ammunition with a 50 round capacity.
- Seburo C-30: A variant of the C-26A, this version is militarised with a focus on offensive capability. It features a longer barrel, optical sights, and an underbarrel 40x51mm Grenade Launcher. For Combat Extended, 5.45x45mm ammunition with a 50 round capacity for the primary gun, and 40x46mm grenades for the underbarrel launcher.

# PRECISION RIFLES
- Seburo SRPS: A scaled-down version of the venerable Seburo SR-50 rifle, this sniper rifle was designed for police service. Chambered in a smaller calibre, it has less reach than its larger counterpart as well as less firepower, but is much lighter and accurate at distance. Additionally, this model comes fitted with an integral suppressor, which helps with hunting game or raiders. For Combat Extended, .300 Winchester Magnum ammunition with a 15 round capacity.
- Seburo SR-50: A bolt action rifle of massive size- and weight- this gun is capable of blowing holes through cyberised and armored threats at long distance with its extreme firepower. Its also rather loud, though. For Combat Extended, .50 BMG ammunition with an 11 round capacity.
- Seburo SR-50 Suppressed: This variant of the SR-50 features an incredibly large suppressor in a serious attempt to tame its gunshots. It makes an oddly decent hunting tool for fauna of unusual size. For Combat Extended, .50 BMG ammunition with an 11 round capacity.
- Seburo AASR: This monstrosity of a rifle is designed to be wielded by cyberised users against heavily armored targets. Firing high velocity armor piercing rounds, this rifle combines the accuracy of many precision rifles thanks to its advanced electronics and stability with the heavy firepower required to take out tanks or mechs.

# HMGS
- Seburo MG: An imposing bullpup HMG, this was designed with bionically augmented users in mind. Has hard hitting, armor-piercing firepower with decent accuracy at distance at the cost of being quite bulky and heavy. For Combat Extended, .50 BMG ammunition with a 115 round capacity. Yes, really.

^^ Footnote: Underbarrel launchers only function for Vanilla 1.5 and Combat Extended users currently, as Vanilla 1.4 does not offer me the tools to implement this there. Sorry!

// COMBAT EXTENDED
This mod will self-patch when loaded after Combat Extended and was balanced based off of CE's Gun Stats and Projectiles Calculator, with some adjustments. Identical patches for 1.4 CE will load for 1.5 CE and should work, but may break as CETeam updates their dev version on Github and I try to keep up.

Currently this mod will also add three new ammo types, as well as an additional variation of the 5.7x28mm ammo.

// COMPATIBILITY
- Should be safe to add to save games. It is never safe to remove a mod from a save, but removing this mod should not cause significant issues.
- Contains mod extensions for compatibility with Muzzle Flash mod. Suppressed guns do not use this, as they do not really produce muzzle flashes.
- Contains adjustment defs for compatibility with Aelanna's Weapon Racks mod.
- Not tested for multiplayer compatibility. If it works, you can tell me in the comments.

// CHANGELOG
1.2.3 // 11-07-2024
- Updated to README.txt adding separate licenses for the mod and art assets, also fixed typos within it.

1.2.2 // 21-06-2024
- Quick hotfix for a minor issue with an incorrectly named parent def.

1.2.1 // 21-06-2024
- Mod name changed to 'GiTS Seburo Advanced Weapon Systems' in line with mod series; also updated preview image.
- All guns textures have been upscaled for camera mods that provide zoom, such as Camera+, to be able to catch more details on the textures.
- HugsLib's mod update news feature is now supported; additionally to be 100% clear, HugsLib is NOT a new dependency and is NOT required to run this mod.
- Changes to Manifest.xml and About.xml to update or provide support for some external mod managers.
- Minor folder and file structure changes.

1.2.0 // 06-06-2024
General Changes:
- Added the Seburo AASR for all versions, a monstrous bolt-action firing extremely high velocity rounds with extreme precision. It is also somehow louder than firing a SR-50, cover your ears!
- Fixed some XML comments so the poor sap who forks this/continues this mod in the future can understand my garbage.

Combat Extended:
- Added 12.5x130mm ammos for the Seburo AASR.
- Changed 5.7x28mm+P ammoClass to be more representative of the ammo.
- Fixed a typo in the CompProperties_FireModes of all precision rifles. They were *almost* burst fire capable due to this, can you imagine a 50cal rifle burst firing five shots? The horror.

1.1.0 // 04-06-2024
- Added Muzzle Flash mod compatibility for all guns.
- Upscaled and updated mod icon.
- Minor folder structure and XML changes.

1.0.1 // 02-06-2024
General Changes:
- Removed trigger guard on the Seburo M10 texture, as in a majority of depictions it lacks this.
- Added some detail and removed cleaning rod from Togusa's Mateba 2008M texture, as this is not stored on the right side of the gun but rather the left, and the texture is of the right side perspective.
- Adjusted preview image, as Steam hates gradients with any contrast it seems for smaller display screens such as on mobile.

Combat Extended:
- 5.45x18mm 7N7 ammunition for gameplay reasons has received increased damage for all ammo types (ex. FMJ damage 6 -> 10) and a penetration buff for all types (ex. FMJ 3.75mm -> 4.5mm RHA). Accordingly, muzzle velocity has also been increased (CE bullet speed 64 -> 100).

1.0.0 // 30-05-2024
- Initial mod release with support for Rimworld 1.4 and 1.5 versions.
- Included mod compatibility supports Combat Extended 1.4 and Aelanna's Weapon Racks for 1.4 and 1.5.
